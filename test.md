Online articles that explain \\sd~[@bogaard2022an; @alammar2022the; @hosni2022getting; @andrew2023how; @andrew2023absolute] often assume that the audience has knowledge about machine learning and use jargon and mathematical equations that can be daunting for non-experts [@alammar2022the; @hosni2022getting; @andrew2023how]. Tutorials in the form of Google Colab notebooks [@patil2022stable; @whitaker2022grokking] primarily focus on code implementation, while blog posts for beginners [@bogaard2022an; @andrew2023absolute] mostly address deployment and prompt engineering. \nTo help users quickly understand how \\sd generates an image, \\de provides easy-to-understand explanations of its complex architecture and operations, integrating multiple abstraction levels through fluid animations and interactive elements.\n\n## Design Goals\nBy reviewing literature and online resources, we have identified four design goals ([G\\ref{goal:summary}]-[G\\ref{goal:webbased}]) aimed at addressing the challenges people may face while learning about \\sd:\n\n**G\\ref{goal:summary}. Visual summary of \\sd.** \\sd is comprised of multiple model components, each with a complex structure [@rombach2022high; @platen2022testing]. Additionally, its incremental image generation, which refines noise into the vector representation of a high-resolution image, is a cyclic process that is uncommon in neural networks. \\de aims to provide an overview of the model architecture and data flow to help users quickly understand its overall structure (see Section \\ref{subsec:420:architecture}). \n\n**G\\ref{goal:interactive}. Interactive interface tightly integrating different levels of abstraction.** The image generation process of \\sd's image generation involves...\n\n<!-- Citation keys referenced -->\n[@bogaard2022an; @alammar2022the; @hosni2022getting; @andrew2023how; @andrew2023absolute; @patil2022stable; @whitaker2022grokking; @rombach2022high; @platen2022testing]
