The BSR-degradation process is a degradation pipline which applies JPEG compressions noise, camera sensor noise, different image interpolations for downsampling, Gaussian blur kernels and Gaussian noise in a random order to an image. We found that using the bsr-degredation process with the original parameters as in (@bsrgan) leads to a very strong degradation process.
