# Welcome

Welcome to this course on prompt engineering! 

I like to think of prompt engineering (PE) as: **How to talk to AI to get it to do what you want**. 



With many recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), 
prompt engineering has become a sought-after and valuable skill for getting AI to do what you want. 
This course focuses on applied PE techniques, and we expect readers to have minimal knowledge of machine learning. If you are new to these concepts (AI, machine learning, programming etc.) I recommend starting with the [Basics](https://learnprompting.org/docs/category/-basics) section and reading [Instructions](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/intro) first. 

## The single most important part of this course is your feedback!
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, you can:
  - Make an **[issue on GitHub](https://github.com/trigaten/Learn_Prompting/issues/new/choose)**
  - Email us at [learnprompting@gmail.com](mailto:learnprompting@gmail.com)
  - Join [Discord](https://learnprompting.org/discord) community
  - Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/learnprompting)
  - We also have a [Consulting Interest Form](https://learnprompting.org/consulting)

Even the smallest amount of feedback is very helpful!

## Course philosophy

**Quick Iterations** - Since new PE content is published almost daily, 
I will update this course frequently with short articles about new techniques.
Let me know what you want to hear more about!

Part of this philosophy is **error iteration**. If you ever see something that you
don't quite understand, even something small, that's on me. **Please make an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/trigaten/Learn_Prompting/issues/new/choose)**!

**Focus on Practicality** - We will focus on applied, practical techniques that you can use immediately for your applications.

**Examples ASAP** - We will put examples in the articles as soon as possible so you can get a feel for the techniques as quickly as possible.

We'll philosophize more about this when we have time ðŸ˜Š
