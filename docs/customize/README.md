Their are several ways to integrate your own images, concepts and inside with stable diffusion.

- **[Fine Tuning](./fine-tuning.md)**: training a pre-trained model to generate images from your own dataset.
- **[Textual inversion](./textual-inversion.md)**: finding the corresponding text embedding for a given image dataset.
- **[Dreambooth](./dreambooth.md)**: finetuning a pre-trained model with regularization images to generate images from your own dataset and keeping the editability of the original model
- **[Hypernetworks](./hypernetworks.md)**: training a small network to edit the model to generate images from a given dataset.
- **[LoRA](./lora.md)**: finding the product of two matrices that edit the attention layers of the network
- **[ControlNet](./controlnet.md)**: training a parallel model to use image conditionning when generating images
